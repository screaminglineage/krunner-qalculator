# Modified version of KRunner Qalculator Plugin

This repo contains a modified version of the [KRunner Qalculator Plugin](https://github.com/kas-cor/krunner-qalculator) with a
couple of simple changes. 

- No longer updates the exchange rates on each keypress and only updates them when the plugin is initialized
- Allows for `$` in the query to support currency conversion (Eg. `$12` works now)

The rest of this file is the original README.md.

- Qt 6.x
- CMake
- Make
- sudo privileges for installation

### Dependencies
- `libqalculate` (qalc command must be available in $PATH)
- KRunner development files

## Installation

1. Ensure all dependencies are installed
2. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/kas-cor/krunner-qalculator.git
   cd krunner-qalculator

- Restart KRunner automatically

## Uninstallation

To remove the plugin:
```bash
./uninstall.sh
```

## Usage

1. Press `Alt+Space` to open KRunner
2. Type your mathematical expression
3. Press Enter to see the result

### Examples:
- Basic calculations: `2 + 2 =`
- Currency conversion: `100 USD to EUR =`
- Unit conversion: `100 km/h to mph =`
- Equations: `solve x^2 + 2x + 1 = 0`

## Troubleshooting

1. If KRunner doesn't show the plugin:
   - Make sure KRunner is restarted after installation
   - Check if qalc is installed and available in PATH

2. If calculations don't work:
   - Verify libqalculate is properly installed
   - Check the syntax of your expression
